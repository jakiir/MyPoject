To meet these expectations, the Brain Science Institute (BSI) was established in 1997 as part of RIKEN, an independent research institution supported by the Japanese government. BSI has a mission to produce innovative research and technology leading to scientific discoveries of the brain. In addition, BSI aims to develop domestic and international brain researchers by creating an environment that will integrate various intellectual disciplines and from that convergence find solutions that will ultimately benefit society in the realms of medicine, engineering, business, and education. In striving toward this goal, BSI has become a leading international center for brain research with a reputation for discovery, innovation, training, and globalization of the scientific enterprise.</p>	</div>	<div class="btn"><a href="#aboutRikenBSI_Director"><img src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/images/title/btn_director.png" alt="Word from the Director" width="309" height="60" /></a></div></div><div class="right">	<p class="img"><img src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/images/img_00.jpg" alt="Riken Brain Science Institute Neuroscience for Society" width="373" height="526" /></p></div></section><section id="aboutRikenBSI01"><div class="right">	<h2><img src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/images/title_01.png" alt="Innovative Research" width="562" height="39" /></h2>	<div class="txt">	<p class="last">BSI engages in interdisciplinary and collaborative research, and integrates various disciplines including medicine, biology, physics, technology, computer science, and psychology. Our research objectives are broad in scope, ranging from understanding molecules, cells, circuits, systems, and behavior, in health and disease. However, at a conceptual level we focus on the neural circuit as the core element of brain function for bridging the atomic and microscopic levels of molecular and cellular neurobiology with the network and systems levels of cognition and computation. Investigating the brain will also require the development of new technologies and we are committed to research that addresses important questions in neuroscience with innovative methods and that creates links to other fast moving areas of science.</p>	</div></div><div class="left">	<p class="img"><img src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/images/img_01.jpg" alt="Innovative Research" width="373" height="373" /></p></div></section><section id="aboutRikenBSI02"><div class="left">	<h2><img src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/images/title_02.png" alt="Global Perspective" width="373" height="39" /></h2>	<div class="txt">	<p class="last">BSI strives to create an international culture of science. In doing so, BSI is considered to be a leading model for the internationalization of science in Japan. Scientists from all over the world converge at BSI to engage in research and then many depart to continue their careers at leading universities and research institutions around the world. Of our approximately 500 researchers and technicians, about 20% are from abroad. In addition, we have nearly 300 visiting researchers. Starting with our use of English as the official language of communication at the institute, resources for manuscript writing and editing, and the Help Desk, which offers assistance with day-to-day life beyond the laboratory, BSI is dedicated to creating an environment that not only supports but creates scientists with a global perspective.</p>	</div></div><div class="right">	<p class="img"><img src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/images/img_02.png" alt="from FY 2006 to FY 2009." width="602" height="485" /></p></div></section><section id="aboutRikenBSI03"><div class="right">	<h2><img src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/images/title_03.png" alt="Career Development" width="562" height="39" /></h2>	<div class="txt">	<p class="last">BSI is committed to fostering not only the development of cutting-edge research, but also cutting-edge researchers.

That window led me to a major discovery in the field of immunology, and it was after that discovery—when deciding what to study next—that the idea came to me of researching the brain.</p>	<p>The brain is one of the greatest mysteries known to mankind, on par with the mystery of the universe itself. Just thinking about it stimulates the imagination.</p>	<p>The RIKEN Brain Science Institute (BSI), where I currently serve as director, brings together researchers from many different disciplines and from many different parts of the world to pursue a broad range of theoretical and applied research. This research ranges from microscopic-level molecular mechanisms at synapses, neurons, and neural networks, to the macroscopic-level phenomena of recognition, learning and memory, and further to areas such as language acquisition and the interface between brains and computers.</p>	<p>As a pioneer in the field of brain science, BSI has a track record of groundbreaking discoveries in the field. Its development of basic infrastructure technology for the global research community as well as its contribution to academic scholarship has earned BSI a reputation as one of the most highly respected brain science research centers in the world.</p>	<p class="last">Today, BSI is taking on a more important role than ever before, with society placing increasing demands on brain science and the possibilities it offers. Research efforts at BSI to clarify neural circuit mechanisms have begun to answer these demands with, among other things, a range of cutting-edge new technologies. BSI is also active in seeking to clarify the underlying causes of brain dysfunctions such as Alzheimer's disease and mental disorders, whose severe consequences cast a shadow over our society today. Through partnerships with industry, BSI also strives to find ways to benefit society by applying basic knowledge gained from research. </p>	</div></div><div class="right">	<p class="img"><img src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/images/img_06.jpg" alt="Susumu Tonegawa, Ph.D. Director, RIKEN Brain Science Institute" width="468" height="331" /></p>	<div class="txt">	<p>With an eye toward the future of brain science, BSI aims to train the next generation of scientists, and has devoted significant energy toward supporting young researchers.</p>	<p>Among the various fields of science, only brain science has a scope broad enough to cover the full range of human activities.
